//Hello, this is a Yarn test script!
//Each line of dialogue will be displayed separately.
//You can also prompt the player to select choices like this:
//-> Choice 1
//    Notice that Choices begin with "->"
//    You can indent below a Choice to say stuff in response to that choice
//-> Choice 2
//    Like, this line only appears if the player selects Choice 2
//Anyway, good luck with Yarn!

“Plus, I’ve just been having these strange dreams lately and I don’t know why.”
“Don’t take those lightly, dreams have a way of revealing secrets.”
“But enough of this superstitious talk, time to get back to work.”
“Right!”
“Now, I remember you wanted to tell me something earlier?”
“Yeah, I need to leave work early today. Emilia and I planned to go scavenging in the woods tonight.”
“Hmph, right. You did put in extra work yesterday… Very well.”
“I wanted to get started repairing the old drill you found scavenging last week. How long until you leave?”

-> “I have about 45 minutes.”
	“We’ll have to be fast then!”
-> “I have about 2 hours.”
	“Alright then. Get me my tools.”
