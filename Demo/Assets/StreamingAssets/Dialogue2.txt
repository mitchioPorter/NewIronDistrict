Breya|"Sorry, I’ve just been really stressed."|1|L
Breya|"Plus, I’ve just been having these strange dreams lately and I don’t know why."|1|L

Soren|"But enough of this superstitious talk, time to get back to work."|0|R
Breya|"Right!"|1|L
Soren|"Now, I remember you wanted to tell me something earlier?"|0|R
Breya|"Yeah, I need to leave work early today. Emilia and I planned to go scavenging in the woods tonight."|1|L
Soren|"Hmph, right. You did put in extra work yesterday… Very well."|0|R
Soren|"I wanted to get started repairing the old drill you found scavenging last week. How long until you leave?"|0|R
Breya|"I have about two hours."|1|L
Soren|“Alright then. Get me my tools.”|0|R
